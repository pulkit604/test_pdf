6.7.1 REMAINING POTENTIAL OF ICE
DOWNSIZING & SUPER CHARGING
• potential savings: 13% (in combination with downsizing)
• Increase inflation pressure in combustion
chamber -> performance improvement
• engine map characteristic remains unchanged
• concepts (among others): exhaust gas
turbocharger (high speed), compressor (low speed)
• supercharging facilitates reduction of the engine range
• Example: BMW 1 Series: 4-cylinder in-line diesel engine
displacement (all models): 1995 cm³
performance: 116d: 115 hp (max. 260 Nm @ 1.750-2.500 rpm)
118d: 143 hp (max. 300 Nm @ 1.750-2.500 rpm)
120d: 177 hp (max. 350 Nm @ 1.750-3.000 rpm)

• Depth of discharge: Discharge to low states of charge
• Deep discharge: terminal voltage drops below threshold, the negative
electrode can corrode and become detached.
• Overload: terminal voltage rises above threshold, electrodes may partially
decompose or oxidize
• Volume change: expansion of the electrode material in intercalation up to 9%
• Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) film: top layer on the negative electrode
reaction with electrolyte
• High temperatures: Accelerated reaction of electrode and electrolyte
• calendrical aging: Independent cycles, parasitic reaction of lithium with

Examples:

AZT (Allianz Zentrum für Technik)

•

FF (Full Frontal)

•

ODB (Offset Deformable Barrier)

These and other standardized methods gain insights into the deformation behavior and
the signal transmission of the vehicle structure in different load cases already during
the early development phase of a vehicle.

In this way any weak points can be detected in good time and corrected if necessary.

7.2 INFLUENCE OF THE VEHICLE STRUCTURE

AZT/RCAR-TEST

10o

www.imech.de

•

"Insurance test" established by the "Alliance
Center for Technology" to estimate the repair
effort in light rear-end collisions and parking
bumps

•

Restraint systems must not trigger

•

No damage to the side member structure
and the components in the front end

•

Since 2006 additional 10°angle barrier

7.2 INFLUENCE OF THE VEHICLE STRUCTURE
TYPICAL ACCIDENT SCENARIOS FOR THE FRONT STRUCTURE
FF (FULL FRONTAL) - TEST

• In the FF crash, a vehicle strikes a rigid
obstacle with the entire front end.

www.imech.de

•

This "High Speed Crash" is driven depending
on applicable regulations of the respective
country with collision speeds between 50 and
56 km/h.

•

In the US, Japan and China, this crash
scenario is part of the standard portfolio,

•

In Europe, this load case is not tested.

7.2 INFLUENCE OF THE VEHICLE STRUCTURE
TYPICAL ACCIDENT SCENARIOS FOR THE FRONT STRUCTURE
OBD TEST

www.imech.de

•

The Offset Deformable Barrier Test is both
part of the European frontal impact
regulations and an integral part of
international testing.

•

The front part of the barrier consists of a soft
aluminum honeycomb structure.

•

The rear part consists of a solid concrete
block.

•

This crash structure simulates the
deformation behavior of a second vehicle as
a collision partner.

•

The 40% level of coverage initiates an offset
impact because, according to accident
statistics, the offset frontal impact is the most
frequently reported road accident involving
personal injury.

Change of momentum for the two cars:
∆𝐼2 = 𝑚2 0𝑣2 − 𝑒𝑣2
∆𝐼1 = 𝑚1 0𝑣1 − 𝑒𝑣1 ,

∆𝐼1 + ∆𝐼2 = 0 ⇒ 𝑚1 𝑒𝑣1 + 𝑚2 𝑒𝑣2 = 𝑚1 0𝑣1 + 𝑚2 0𝑣2

We assume a semi-elastic impact:
𝑒

𝑣1 − 𝑒𝑣2 = −𝜀( 0𝑣1 − 0𝑣2 )

7.3.2 CRASH SEVERITY PARAMETERS

EBS (Equivalent Barrier Speed)
For this criterion, the impact velocity on a flat rigid barrier is used as a
comparison, during which the same deformation work 𝑊𝑑𝑒𝑓 is implemented
during the collision as in the case of a real accident.
ETS (Equivalent Test Speed)
This quantity corresponds to the impact speed on a suitable, fixed or movable
obstacle, in which the same deformation work as in the real accident is
implemented. It is also assumed again that the damages that occur here can
represent those arising in the real accident.
EES (Energy Equivalent Speed)
Here, the criterion is the impact speed on any fixed obstacle, in which the
same deformation work as in the real accident is implemented. The speed 𝑣𝐸𝐸𝑆
is then calculated to:

𝑣𝐸𝐸𝑆 =

𝑊𝑑𝑒𝑓
𝑚

7.3.2 CRASH SEVERITY PARAMETERS
Velocity change Δv
Here, the difference between the collision speed and the exit speed is taken as
the basis.
Ride-Down-Effect
The ride-down effect provides information about the extent to which the occupant
protection systems are effective during an accident.
It is calculated with the maximum deformation path 𝑠max of the vehicle, the
deformation path of the vehicle 𝑠𝑅𝐷 at time 𝑡𝑅𝐷 from which the occupant restraint
becomes effective, to:
𝑠max − 𝑠𝑅𝐷
100%
𝑅𝐷𝐸 =
𝑠max
A value of 100% means that the deceleration of the occupant starts
simultaneously with the deceleration of the vehicle at t = 0. Correspondingly, a
value of 0% means that the occupant did not experience any delay by the restraint
systems until the maximum vehicle deformation has been reached.
